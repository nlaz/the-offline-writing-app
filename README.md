# The Offline Writing App

The internet is full of distractions. Serious writers shouldn't be distracted by the endless buffet of cat memes. The Offline Writing App is the only writing app that makes you disconnect so you can get some focused writing.

### How to Use It

To use it, simply disconnect from the internet. Turn your Wi-Fi off, turn on your airplane mode on, disconnect your internet tubes, etc. When you are done, turn your Wi-Fi back on and copy-and-paste your writing to your heart's delight.
